Basic process of adding and using a new tag:

* Create a global tag by adding a new line to the global tag dictionary `all_global_tags` in the file
(https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/blob/main/esp/esp/tagdict/__init__.py).
Formatting instructions are there in comments, but the format for each tag in the dictionary is
  `'tag_name': (is the tag boolean?, "some help text for admins")`
where the first coordinate in the tuple determines whether the tag is retrieved by the
function `Tag.getBooleanTag` (if so, set the first coordinate to `True`) or `Tag.getTag` (set it to `False`).
This formatting information is also in the comments of the file.

* To create a program-specific tag, add the new tag's name to the program tag dictionary `all_program_tags` in the same file linked above.
Program tags are used with `Tag.getProgramTag()` or `Tag.getBooleanTag()` with a program argument in place of a boolean one in the
first coordinate.

* In order to make use of your new tag, find the file(s) where you want to use the tag's data, and make sure to include the
line `from esp.tagdict.models import Tag`.
Use `Tag.getTag('tag_name')` (or the apprpriate variant, `getBooleanTag` or `getProgramTag`) to retrieve the value of the tag in each file.
Note: due to the import line, it is not possible to use tag data in `models\__init__.py`.
You may want to implement checks against the validity of the tag's data.
It is especially helpful to send a helpful error message to either the admin and the server log. :)

Please also add a description of your tag to the LU Wiki page related to tags.
