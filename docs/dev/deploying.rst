Deploying to production
=======================

Deploying a new site
--------------------

To deploy a new site, first make sure you know:

#. the hostname the chapter prefers
#. the chapter's contact email address
#. the group's name (e.g. "MIT ESP" or "Yale Splash")
#. the chapter's preferred theme

Then ssh to ``diogenes``, grab the latest version of
``deploy/server_setup/new_site.sh``, ``cd`` to ``/lu/sites``, and
run ``sudo new_site.sh --all``.  (You may instead clone the repository
yourself, ``cd`` into it, and run the script from there.)  Follow the
instructions to set up the site.  For the site directory name, choose something
short that's likely to stay unique and understandable as we add more chapters.
When it does the "create superuser", you should create yourself an account;
afterwards chapter admins can create their own accounts and you can make them
admins.  At the end, it will give you instructions for setting up DNS,
currently on ``plato``.

If something doesn't work, and you need to re-run a particular step, you can do
so by passing the appropriate flag to ``new_site.sh``.  Note that some steps
won't work if you run them twice, so if a step fails partway through you may
need to complete or undo it manually.  The script will remember your settings;
you just need to tell it the same directory again.

Finally, email the chapter to let them know that you've set up their site, and
with instructions to set up their accounts, whatever parts of their theme you
didn't set up.  You can also point them at the documentation in the repository
and on the LU wiki and at websupport.

Deactivating a site
-------------------

To deactivate a site, simply remove or comment out its lines in
``/etc/apache2/sites-available/esp_sites.conf``, ``/etc/crontab``, and
``/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf``, remove it from the DNS config on
``plato``, and move its site directory to ``/lu/sites/inactive``.

TODO(benkraft): write a quick script for this.
