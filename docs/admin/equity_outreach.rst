Equity outreach student lists
=============================

The Student Profile Editor module exposes several at-risk student cohorts as
**user lists** for use in the Communications Panel and User Records.

Cohorts
-------

* **equity_incomplete_registration** — Started profile but not confirmed
* **equity_unconfirmed_registration** — Enrolled in classes but not confirmed
* **equity_incomplete_financial_aid** — Financial aid started but incomplete
* **equity_transportation_barrier** — Potential transportation barrier
* **equity_low_hours_or_waitlisted** — Low class-hours or waitlisted

How to use
----------

1. Open **Manage → Communications Panel** or **Manage → User Records** for your program.
2. Choose one of the equity lists from the list dropdown.
3. Use the existing email, SMS, or export tools as needed.

No separate Equity Outreach module or dashboard is required; these lists are
available whenever the Student Profile Editor (registration) module is enabled.
