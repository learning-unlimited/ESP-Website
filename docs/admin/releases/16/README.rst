  - The entire receipt can be overriden by a single template override or by program-specific template overrides (like before)

June 2025 Patch
===============

New theme!
~~~~~~~~~~
For the first time in 9 years, we are adding a new theme to our roster! We are including a beta version of this theme, called "droplets", in this patch release and plan to release a final version in another patch later this summer after we collect and address feedback. The key foci for this new theme are: a modern "feel", responsiveness and mobile friendly, flexible and customizable, dropdown menus to accommodate complex navigation, and better use of screen width.

Notables features of the new theme include the following:

- A clean header navigation bar and matching footer
- Hoverable dropdown menus for navigation (customizable as with other themes)

  - This includes the hidden admin toolbar
- Built with `Bootstrap <https://getbootstrap.com/>`_ to have a modern "feel"

  - We're still using an old version of Bootstrap, but we plan to upgrade that in the future
- Designed from the ground up to be mobile friendly

  - Some individual pages may still not be entirely mobile friendly, but we're hoping to fix that in the future
  - We're hoping to expand this to other themes in the future
- Wider content (the main content is up to 66% wider than on bigpicture and 95% wider than on fruitsalad!)
- Taller content (we've reduced the size of the header)
- Customization

  - Font size
  - Header/footer colors
  - Dropdown menu color
  - Logo and header visibility
  - Navigation and contact info

As part of the release of this new theme, we have also implemented the following theme-agnostic features:

- Partial redesign of the Main Program Management page
- Partial redesign of the Main Onsite page
- Partial redesign of the Dashboard page
- Complete redesign of the Printables page
- Expansion of various forms and tables to use more screen width
- Partial redesign of the theme editor

Minor new features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added a default email template which can be overriden with a template override of 'email/default_email.html'

  - We plan to expand on this functionality in the future with a selection of templates and the ability to easily make your own
- Cleaned up the styling of several printables (e.g., rosters and attendance lists)
- Added a small hover effect to the left-side tabs in the fruitsalad theme
- Added a `robots.txt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt>`_ file to prevent various AI bot crawlers from accessing the website
- Replaced the very specific "Planned Purchases" help text in the class registration form with much more generic help text (which can still be changed using the 'teacherreg_help_text_purchase_requests' tag)
- Improved the error messages when trying to access a custom form module during student/teacher registration that isn't properly configured
- The admin toolbar is now visible even when morphed

Minor bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an error associated with the Student Profile Form when the 'show_student_graduation_years_not_grades' tag was enabled

- Fixed the Teacher Events Management Module erroneously appearing in the "Additional Modules" list when it already appears above
- Fixed a bug that occurred when a student opted to make a donation, then paid via credit card, then revisited the extra costs page (these donations are now shown on the extra costs page to reduce confusion)
- Fixed a bug that occurred when the QSD field on the /myesp/accountmanage/ page was edited (this editable field has now been moved beneath the important buttons on this page)
- Fixed the generation of the meal tickets printable
- Fixed various bugs in the UserSearchController (the UI that is used for the comm panel), mostly related to when a user is directed here with a custom link
- Fixed the functionality of the unenroll module and made some UI improvements (this module hadn't been touched in 9 years)
