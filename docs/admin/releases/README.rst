Release notes for the official ESP Website releases. Each release note will
tell you what's new and changed in each version.

Stable releases
===============

These releases occur every four to twelve months, usually during the Splash
off-season and after many site improvements. At some point prior to the
release, the new code is be declared semi-stable, and is deployed to all of the
live sites. There is then a period of manual testing and bugfixing on the live
sites before the code is declared stable. At this point, the code on the live
sites is frozen until the next release.

Security and bugfix releases
============================

Whenever a security problem or other major bug is discovered, the code is
temporarily unfrozen in order to deploy a hotfix to all the live sites. No
other changes are made at this time. These releases are not scheduled,
announced, named, or otherwise recorded.

Development releases
====================

A site that requests newer features not yet available in the latest stable
release may elect to be updated to a later version of the code, with the caveat
that the code is not necessarily stable or well-tested.
