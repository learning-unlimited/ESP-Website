Profiles
~~~~~~~~

  - Use this functionality to get lunch orders from your students!

Student Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed the handling of donation line items in the credit card module (hotfixed to SR14)
- Fixed a bug with the credit card form in the credit card module (hotfixed to SR14)
- If there are no costs to cover for a program, the financial aid module is now hidden, even if it is enabled
- If the class changes deadline is still open (i.e., students can make class changes on the normal website), then students can now make class changes on the webapp, even if they aren't checked in

  - The default checkin note at the top of the webapp has been updated to reflect that only classrooms are now hidden until a student is checked in (this text can be modified with a tag)
- Fixed a bug where javascript was being displayed as text in the course catalog

- Fixed the ability for students to register for classes from the onsitecatalog page

Student self checkin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Students can now check themselves in (if the tag setting is enabled) if they have completed all required registration steps (e.g., custom forms, payment, etc)

  - If students have not completed any required registration steps, these steps are highlighted on the self checkin page
  - There are two self checkin options: 1) students just need to visit a page and click a button, or 2) students need a code that is unique to them and the program. If using codes, these can be printed on the back of nametags.
  - There is also a tag (enabled by default) to require full payment before allowing self checkin. If a credit card module is enabled, students will be directed there. If no module is enabled, students will be instructed to see an admin team member.
