Changelog
=========

Moderator integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Moderators (or observers, teaching assistants, etc) for individual sections are now fully integrated and supported by the entirety (or close to it) of the website. This integration includes several additions and improvements to the website, which are activated by (and only by) enabling the new TeacherModeratorModule:

- A form is added to teacher registration which allows users to indicate if they are interested in moderating. They can specify how many time blocks they want to moderate, select which categories they are most interested in, and provide any comments they might have.
- The ajax scheduling page has a new panel that enables the assignment of moderators to specific sections. Various filters are included to filter moderators, and there is also an option to only show sections which match the preferred categories of the selected moderator. In this functionality, teacher availability is used as moderator availability. Also, while moderators specify how many time blocks they would like to moderate, there is no actual enforcement of this (but the interface does show when it has been exceeded).
- Moderator info is listed on the /manageclass, /coteachers (admin version only), /editavailability, and /classavailability pages.
- Assigned moderators have their section assignments listed on the main teacher registration page (beneath taught classes), where they can see details about the sections and access the attendance page.
- Similar information is on the teacher webapp (in the schedule and in the specific section info pages).
- Moderators are listed on and can be checked-in via the onsite teacher check-in page.
- Moderators are listed in the onsite attendance module for classes without attendance.
- Several new printables are available which have moderator info (e.g. individual schedules, moderator schedule spreadsheet).
- Several existing printables have moderator information (e.g. class list, room schedules).
- Moderator stats are shown on the dashboard and teacher big board.

Custom forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overhauled the custom forms creation frontend page and backend functionality. Most notably, this now allows for custom forms to be edited (even after users have responded to a custom form). This includes adding, removing, and editing fields, instructions, and pages/sections. To edit a custom form, you can select it from within the creation frontend or with one of the new links on the custom form landing page. In addition, the following changes/fixes were made:

- Fixed the handling of long field titles in the responses table.
- Added an "Other" option to the gender field.
- Fixed a bug/error that occurred when users entered responses that were too long for a text field.
- The custom form landing page now lists the ID of each custom form (for admin reference).
- Custom forms can now be linked to specific program registration modules (e.g., the teacher custom form module), and the appropriate tags will be created upon form creation.
- HTML in field labels and help texts is now rendered for users.
- Better error handling and reporting during custom form creation.
- The field type of existing fields can now be changed.
- Fixed a bug where blank options were added to multi-answer fields (e.g., checkboxes, dropdown).
- Fixed the teacherinfo and contactinfo fields.
- Field help text is now shown in the form preview as it will be shown in the real form. Correct answers are also indicated on the form preview.

Program management changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When importing the settings from a previous program, class registration module info settings, student class registration module info settings, and tag settings are now copied to the new program. New programs based on previous programs should now function almost exactly like the previous programs.
- Added new program tags to change the tolerance (in minutes) of contiguous blocks for the teacher availability page and for scheduling purposes.
- Added custom widgets to many of the tag settings (preventing potentially site-breaking tag values).
- Added a new tag `grade_increment_date` that allows admins to adjust when student grades increment (e.g., before or after a summer program).
- Added a frontend user interface to add, remove, edit, and import line items.
- Fixed text wrapping for the module questions on the new program and program settings pages.
- Fixed some modules that were unintentionally being included by default (class change request module).
- Added module questions for the Class Change Request, Moderator, and Student Acknowledgment modules.
- Fixed a bug that occurred when no modules were selected.
- Fixed a bug that caused an invalid calculation of the program admission cost.
- The "choice" field for classroom furnishings and floating resources now accepts up to 200 characters.
- Timeslots for classrooms and floating resources on the resources page are no longer grouped if they occur <15 minutes apart.
- Added documentation for modules, which is shown on the main program management page. The additional modules on this page are now alphabetized.
- Fixed section alignment on the main program management page.

User search modules changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- For the Arbitrary User List module, the list of available fields is now filtered based on the selected user type.
- Added a new module to generate a state and/or zipcode map of a set of users.
- Added new user search filters for students, including number of registered class hours and registered class times.
- Added new user search filters for teachers, including teaching times, training/interview times, and teachers of a particular student.
- Added the ability to include and/or exclude multiple user groups when filtering users.
- All user search filters are now cleared whenever you change user type or switch between the different tabs.

Contact info changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Contact infos now require an associated user.
- Old contact infos have been cleaned up, associating student accounts with their emergency contact and guardian contact infos. Any contact infos without associated users have been deleted, since they are useless.
- Users can now be searched by any guardian or emergency contact information (e.g., find a student account by their parent's email address).
- Added a country field to contact infos. If "International" is selected for the state field in a user's profile, the country field is shown.

Student registration changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Some modules will no longer show up in registration if they are not set up correctly (formstack medliab, extra costs, student applications, and lunch selection).
- The extra costs and donation modules now work when a program has no admission cost.
- Added an option to the student lottery management page to not open student registration once the lottery has been run.
- Added enrollment limit options (max timeslots and max sections) to the class lottery.
- Fixed a bug affecting ranks beyond the first choice in the class lottery.

Teacher registration changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Some modules will no longer show up in registration if they are not set up correctly (teacher availability, teacher training/interviews, and teacher quiz).
- Implemented several improvements to the attendance interface (normal and webapp versions).
- The default availability for the teacher availability form is now none (instead of all/full).
- Added links on the class edit page to the coteachers and catalog preview pages.

Volunteer registration changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Help text is now shown for the comments field.
- Required fields are now marked with asterisks.

Class management changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- All of the section cancellation forms have been merged into a single form allowing admins to cancel multiple sections at once for the same reason. Each section has it's time and date listed.

Statistics and data visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New queries have been added to the /manage/statistics page, including multiprogram statistics on student and teacher registration. The results of these queries include graphs to visualize the change of various metrics across programs through time (e.g. # class-student-hours approved).
- Adjusted the text of the link on the "Manage All Programs" page to reflect the addition of non-student statistics.

Scheduling changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added a button to the scheduling checks page that, when clicked, causes all of the checks to refresh at some interval that is specified by the user.
- Fixed the alignment of the headers in the ajax scheduler when rooms have really long names.
- Fixed the wrong class length scheduling check.
- Fixed the "Mismatched rooms and meeting times" and "Classes not completely scheduled or with gaps" scheduling checks for classes with assigned floating resources.
- Fixed the "Teachers with limited availability" scheduling check for cases where teachers somehow had no availability.
- Fixed the highlighting on the ajax scheduler for when a user is trying to schedule a single-block class on a day with a single lunch block.
- Added scheduling checks to the ajax scheduler that let you see if there are any errors or inconsistencies with how classes have been scheduled (e.g., capacity mismatches, resource mismatches, availability mismatches, double-booked teachers). This does not include all checks from the scheduling checks module, and we plan to keep the scheduling checks module around for the foreseeable future.
- The class directory on the ajax scheduler can now be sorted by ID, category, length, capacity, and teacher availability.
- Fixed a bug that caused sections with floating resources to not be shown in the class directory on the ajax scheduler.

- Added teacher lists to classes on the grid-based class changes interface. Also added teachers as a filterable field.
- Fixed the "Hide past timeblocks" option in the grid-based class changes interface.
- Added an attendance-through-time chart on the attendance landing page that shows the cumulative number of students that have checked in to the program and the number of students that are attending classes for each hour.
- Fixed a page-breaking bug on the teacher check-in page (this was also patched on SR12).
- Added sorting options to the grid-based class changes page (length of section, class ID, fullness, and category).
- Added barcode scanning to teacher check-in. Admins can use physical scanners or personal smart devices.
- The main /onsite page has been redesigned to look like the main /manage page.

- Added shirt statistics for all teachers with a submitted class, enrolled students, attended students, and volunteers to the dashboard.
- Updated the caching of all of the statistics on the dashboard, so they should now always be up-to-date.

Survey changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Survey results are now cached, which should result in much faster load times when viewing any survey result page.

Printable changes

- Added links to usernames in the scheduler, financial aid approval module, and the manage events page.
