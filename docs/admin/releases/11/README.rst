Changelog

Minor new features and fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Can now modify resource choices from the resources management module
- There is now a default login help page /myesp/loginhelp.html that admins can modify.
- For chapters that use barcodes for student check-in, the barcodes can now be scanned
  in using your device's camera, so a physical barcode scanner is no longer needed. The
  default behavior is to check-in the student automatically upon each successful scan.
