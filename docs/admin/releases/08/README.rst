Changelog
=========

Improvements to user search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With this release, the User Search box returns users whose cell phone number or
*parent's* email address matches the query, in addition to the matches that were
previously returned. The search is also more robust to case and whitespace issues.

Improvements to class search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With this release, class search allows you to edit your search at the top of the search page.  The results page also includes a new button to email the teachers of a class, a new button to show all classes and all flags which have comments, and an option to randomize the order of search results, along with a minor bugfix.
