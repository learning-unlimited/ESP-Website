Deletion of login by birthday or school
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before this release, the website included the option for students to log in by
selecting their birthday or school from a list, and then selecting their
username from a list of all student accounts with that birthday or from that
school. This feature has been deleted because it leaks user data: anyone could
go through the list of birthdays or schools one by one and collect this
information for all of our students. Users having trouble logging in are now
encouraged to use the password reset page.
