Changelog
=========

Improvements to scheduling checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Scheduling Diagnostics" module has undergone significant improvements.
Now, instead of waiting a long time for all the checks to be run and rendered,
the page loads instantaneously, and you can run and see the results of
whichever individual checks you want.  You can also sort each check by any
column, and gray out rows (if, for instance, you are done dealing with them).

If the "Scheduling Diagnostics" module is enabled for the program, you can get
to the scheduling checks page by clicking the link "Run Scheduling Diagnostics"
(/manage/[program]/[instance]/scheduling_checks) on the main program
management.

Class flags and class search improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The search interface formerly associated with class flags has been rewritten,
and comes with new search options.  It will also now be easier to add more
search options, so let us know if there are ways you would find it useful to be
able to search. 

Student Registration Big Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a new module for watching the current number of student registrations.
You can get to it from the link "Student Registration Big Board" on the main
program management page, or at /manage/[program]/[instance]/bigboard.  It has
some of the same statistics as the dashboard, but is a lot faster to load, and
has some fun extra numbers too.  Most of the statistics are most useful during
lottery registration, but it is not restricted to the lottery.

Logging current grade during student grade change request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes to the handling of student grade levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, different parts of the website were inconsistent in how
students' grade levels were calculated: sometimes according to the
current school year and sometimes according to the start date of the
relevant program. Now, all grade level logic pertaining to a specific
program is done using student grade levels as of the start date of the
program. (Note that the student's grade is considered to advance at
the beginning of August, so for summer programs this will typically be
the grade that the student just finished.)

The exceptions to this are non-program-specific pages such as the
student profile and grade change requests, where the calculated grade
is only used for display purposes.

Tags to disable shirt types question in profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The newly added ``studentinfo_shirt_type_selection`` Tag allows you to disable
the student profile question that asks about shirt types (straight cut vs
fitted cut), while retaining the question that asks about shirt size. This
complements the existing ``teacherinfo_shirt_type_selection`` Tag, which
controls the same behavior for the teacher and volunteer profiles. For either
of these Tags, set the value to False to disable the question.

On the student profile, neither of the shirt questions appear unless the
``show_student_tshirt_size_options`` Tag is set to True. On the teacher
profile, both shirt questions appear by default, but can be simultaneously
disabled by setting the ``teacherinfo_shirt_options`` Tag to False.

Tags can be added/modified/removed from the /admin/tagdict/tag/ page of the
admin panel.

Customizing PDF letterhead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chapters can now upload a PDF letterhead file, which is used for the student
completion certificate printable.  It should be named "letterhead.pdf" and go
in the folder "latex_media" on the admin panel's file browser.  It can be a
full-page PDF (8.5"Ã—11"), or it can just be a top banner.

UI for flushing individual caches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The page /cache/view_all provides an interface listing all the cached
functions on the website and allowing them to be flushed
individually. This is an alternative to using /manage/flushcache/ when
you know which cache(s) need to be flushed, which may cause less of a
performance hit than flushing all caches at once.

A developer may instruct you to use this in case of a bug where some
data on the site is out of date.

Script to ask teachers to increase their class capacities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the total number of student-class-hours is lower than expected, it can be
beneficial to ask teachers if they are willing to increase their class
capacities. There is a new script which can identify all classes where the
maximum capacity (set by the teachers) is less than the maximum capacity of the
rooms they are scheduled into, and sends the teachers an email asking if they
would be willing to increase their class capacities.

Right now, the script has a hard-coded message and has no web front-end. If you
wish to use this script, email websupport@learningu.org for assistance.

Minor feature additions and bugfixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When viewing and downloading non-anonymous custom form responses,
  you will now be able to see the name, email, and username of each
  respondent. Previously, only the user id was displayed.

- In admin user search queries, when multiple matches are available,
  all results will always be displayed, even if there is an exact
  match. Previously, if there was a username "bob" and you searched
  for "bob", you would be immediately directed to bob's profile, even
  if there was a user with first name "Bob" (but a different
  username) that you were looking for.

- During lottery student registration, cancelling a class subject or
  the last section of a class will email and cancel the registrations
  of students who had starred that class subject, not just the
  students who ranked one of the sections.

- The script that sends comm panel emails is now more robust against failures
  that occur while the script is running. Intermittent failures should never
  prevent subsets of users from receiving an email blast; every targeted user
  should eventually receive the email.

- Signing up for volunteer shifts does not require having an account.

- Some dashboard display improvements.

- If accepting credit card payments, a summary of transactions will
  appear in the admin vitals section of the dashboard.

- Expensive database queries that used to occur during student
  registration workflows were found and eliminated. This should
  improve the performance during registration.

- Added room numbers to teacher check-in for all timeblocks.

- Many miscellaneous bug fixes.

- Many behind-the-scenes changes to make the site easier to work on, improve
  performance, and enable future improvements.
