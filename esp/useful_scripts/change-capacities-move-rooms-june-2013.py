#
# Update capacities and classrooms of classes
#
# Input: a .csv with
# section code, capacity, room
# where empty is no change.  Make sure it has 3 columns always.
#
# Run me from the manage.py shell
#
# Warning: the class capacity changes may not show up immediately in Ajax scheduling due to some caching bugs.  Even a flush cache doesn't work; I'm not sure what the issue is.  If it's a problem, shift-refresh the page open and re-save it from the admin panel, or be patient.
