Menu Release Notes

*** version 0.10.0 ***

* Initial release

* Known issues:

      * Some Firefox extensions disable the ability for JavaScript to prevent  
        the display of the browser's default context menu.  These extensions
        can cause the YUI ContextMenu to stop working.  If you encounter this 
        problem, you can reset the context menu preference in Firefox back to 
        the default by making sure the "Disable or replace context menus" 
        preference is checked:

            Mac Firefox 1.0: 
            -------------------
            Preferences > Web Features > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus

            Mac Firefox 1.5
            -------------------
            Preferences > Context > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus

            Windows Firefox 1.0
            -------------------
            Tools > Options > Web Features > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus

            Windows Firefox 1.5
            -------------------
            Tools > Options > Context > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus
                

*** version 0.11.0 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------
* Overloaded the "addItem" and "insertItem" methods of MenuModule to accept a 
  string or a MenuModuleItem instance

* Added the ability to define a MenuItem instance as being "checked"


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------
* Changing the path for the submenu indicator image of one MenuModuleItem 
  subclass will no longer affect other subclasses

* MenuItem instances built from existing markup without anchor tags will no 
  longer trigger a JavaScript error when clicked

* Modified the implementation of the "imageRoot" property for the 
  MenuModuleItem class so that it is set to a secure/non-secure path when the
  object is instantiated

* Menu instances now resize in response to changes to the browser's font size

* Modified the propagation of the MenuModule class's "submenualignment" 
  configuration property so that it only applies to instances of the same type

* Adjusted the specificity of the style rule that controls the position of a 
  MenuItem instance's submenu indicator image to prevent it from wrapping in IE

* Specified a width and height for submenu indicator images in the Menu 
  stylesheet to ensure that Menu instances are always rendered at the correct 
  width

* Clicking a MenuItem instance will no longer trigger two HTTP GET requests

* Users can now control or shift-click on MenuItem links


Changes:
--------
* In the Menu stylesheet (menu.css), switched from using "first" class to
  "first-of-type" class

* Changed case of MenuModuleItem class's "subMenuIndicator" property 
  to "submenuIndicator"
  

*** version 0.11.3 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------

* Added a "target" configuration property to the MenuModuleItem object that
  allows the user to specify the target of an item's anchor element.  Items 
  that make use of the "target" configuration property will require the user 
  to click exactly on the item's anchor element to navigate to the specified 
  URL.

* Items without a "url" property set will automatically hide their parent 
  menu instance(s) when clicked.


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

* Items in a submenu should now navigate to their specified URL when clicked.

* Removed MenuBar's use of "overflow:hidden."  This fixes an issue in Firefox
  1.5 in which submenus of a Menubar instance cannot overlay other absolutely 
  positioned elements on the page.

* Submenus of a Menubar instance will now automatically have their iframe shim
  enabled in IE<7.

* Statically positioned Menubar and Menu instances will now render with the 
  correct position and dimensions in Safari.

* MenuModuleItem's "focus" method now checks to make sure that an item's 
  "display" style property is not "none" before trying to set focus to its
  anchor element.
  
* A ContextMenu instance will now hide all other ContextMenu instances before
  displaying itself.

* Removed the dead space in front of an item's submenu indicator image in IE.  
  This space was causing an item's submenu to flicker when the user hovered 
  over it.


Changes:
--------

* Moved the DOM event handlers for every menu from the root DIV node of each 
  instance to the document object.  This change reduces the number of DOM event 
  handlers used by Menu to eight, improving the cleanup time required by the 
  Event utility.

    * "showdelay" - Shows the menu after the specified number of milliseconds.  

    * "container" - The containing element the menu should be rendered into.  

    * "clicktohide" - Boolean indicating if the menu will automatically be 
      hidden if the user clicks outside of it.

    * "autosubmenudisplay" - Boolean indicating if submenus are automatically 
      made visible when the user mouses over the menu's items.

* Added a "toString" method to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem, YAHOO.widget.MenuBarItem 
  and YAHOO.widget.ContextMenuItem that returns the class name followed by the 
  value of the item's "text" configuration property.


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

* Setting a YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu instance's "trigger" configuration 
  property will remove all previous triggers before setting up the new ones.

* "destroy" method of YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu cleans up all DOM event handlers.

* Clicking on a menu item with a submenu no longer hides/collapses the 
  entire menu.

* Clicking an item's submenu indicator image no longer collapses the 
  entire menu.
  
  
Changes:

* Switched the default value of the "constraintoviewport" configuration 
  property for YAHOO.widget.Menu to "true."

    * Element reference

* "hide" and "show" methods of statically positioned menus now toggle the their
  element's "display" style property between "block" and "none."
