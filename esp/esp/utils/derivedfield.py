def DerivedField(FieldCls, getter_fn):
    """
    Returns a Django Model Field that is derived, ie., that is
    automatically calculated based on the values of other fields.

    The intent of this field is to push caching out to the database:
    It is sometimes useful to run queries that filter against calculated
    fields or fields that can only be found across an expensive series
    of joins.  For example, sorting classes by their starting times
    or by the number of students in them.  These values can often be
    calculated in SQL by a crazy SQL query; but such queries can be quite
    expensive.  So, let's create a field that stores these calculated
    values, and that automatically recalculates them when they
    change.

    DerivedField() is a field *generator*, not a field itself.
    Its usage is as follows.  Let's say I have a model with an IntegerField:

    #>>> from django.db import models
    #>>> class MyModel(models.Model):
    #>>>     mySum = models.IntegerField(null=False, default=0)

    To make this into a DerivedField, I'd need to do the following:

    #>>> from esp.utils.derivedfield import DerivedField
    #>>> MyNewDerivedFieldType = DerivedField(models.IntegerField, counter_fn)
    #>>> class MyModel(models.Model):
    #>>>     mySum = MyNewDerivedFieldType(null=False, default=0)

    (Or, alternatively,)

    #>>> class MyModel(models.Model):
    #>>>     mySum = DerivedField(models.IntegerField, counter_fn)(null=False, default=0)

    Now, note that I specified an argument "counter_fn".  counter_fn must be
    a function that is cached using the caching API (esp.cache.argcache).
    This code is an extension of the caching API: When that API flushes the
    cache in memcached, this code catches that event and also updates the value
    stored in the database.  So, for example:

    #>>> class Frob(models.Model):
    #>>>     " Example model that we might want to count "
    #>>>     myModelFk = models.ForeignKey(MyModel)
    #>>>
    #>>> from esp.cache import cache_function
    #>>> @cache_function 
    #>>> def counter_fn(self):
    #>>>     return self.frob_set.count()
    #>>> counter_fn.depend_on_row(lambda:Frob, lambda frob: {'self': frob.myModelFk})

    Note that counter_fn() (or getter_fn(), the generic name of this thing)
    must take at most one argument, and that one argument must be
    an instance of the same model that this field is a field on.
    So in the above example, 'self' must always be an instance of MyModel.
    This constraint may be loosened in the future.

    Be careful to make the cache as granular as you possibly can!
    If the above example were to do, for example,

    #>>> counter_fn.depend_on_model(lambda:Frob)

    instead of .depend_on_row(), then every time the Frob table got updated,
    the cache for every row in the MyModel table gets flushed, and so
    counter_fn() *immediately gets called once for every row in MyModel*
    to regenerate the cache!  Unless MyModel is quite tiny, this is going
    to be very expensive.
