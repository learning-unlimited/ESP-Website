    <h1>Choose Your Adventure</h1>
    <p>
    For one Saturday in April, high school students from all over the Chicago area and beyond are welcomed to the Northwestern University campus to take classes from NU students and community members about anything. That's right, anything. Whether you're interested in science, the humanities, or just random things you may never have heard about, we've got a class for you! 
    </p>
