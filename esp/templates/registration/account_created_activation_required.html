<h1>Create a new account</h1>

<p>
You have successfully registered a new account!  Before you can use
your new account, however, you will have to activate it.  An e-mail
has been sent to your address with activation instructions.  Please
follow those instructions in order to continue with program
registration.
</p>

<p>
If you don't receive an activation e-mail, please check your spam
filters and make sure your e-mail service allows e-mail through from
"server@{{ site }}".  You can have the email sent to you again via <a href="{% url 'esp.users.views.resend_activation_view' %}">here</a>.
