<h2>Student Participation Time</h2>
<p>The distribution of student class hours are shown below for each program. These are measured in timeslots; if all timeslots are 2 hr long, double these numbers to get the distribution of hours spent in class.  (Most Splash programs are run with 1 hr timeslots, so the timeslots and class hours are equivalent.)</p>
