<h3>Failure</h3>

<p>Your credit card transaction was not successful.  More information about this is shown below.

{% if error_type == "inconsistent_po" %}
<b>Inconsistent payment information.</b> Please contact the administrators with the following information.
<ul>
    <li>Payment PO number: {{ error_info.request_po }}</li>
    <li>User PO number: {{ error_info.user_po }}</li>
</ul>
{% endif %}

    <li>Charge amount (from internal records): {{ error_info.amount_cents_iac }}</li>
</ul>
{% endif %}

{% if error_type == "declined" %}

{% endif %}

{% if error_type == "invalid" %}
<b>Invalid request.</b>  This is usually caused by a duplicate request (e.g. "refreshing" your Web browser after paying).  It is possible that your payment went through successfully; please return to the payment page to check.
{% endif %}

<b>Authentication error.</b>  The site was unable to authenticate with the payment processor; please let the administrators know so they can correct the issue.

{% endif %}

{% if error_type == "generic" %}
<b>Unknown error.</b>  We received a generic error code from the payment processor.
{% endif %}
