<h1>Admin morph for {{ program.niceName }}</h1>

<p>
From this page you can access any student or teacher account to update their registration information.  Select your target group below; you will be presented with a search page where you can put in a name, ID, or anything else to help find the person you're looking for.  Searching within your program is fastest, but sometimes you need to morph into someone who is not already a student or teacher.  If you have any other ideas for saved groups, ask the webmasters.
