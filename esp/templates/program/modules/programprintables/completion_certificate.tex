{{ prog.program_type }} courses are taught by volunteers, primarily {{ settings.INSTITUTION_NAME }} students.
The content and difficulty of the subjects varies significantly, from non-academic to college-level.
Our program is not accredited to issue credit for any class, however, we leave it to school administrators to decide whether {{ settings.ORGANIZATION_SHORT_NAME }} courses can be counted as substitutes for school classes.

If you would like to talk to an administrator or teacher about the content of a particular course, please email us at {\tt {{settings.DEFAULT_EMAIL_ADDRESSES['default']}. \\
