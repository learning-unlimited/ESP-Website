{{ prog.program_type }} courses are taught by volunteers, primarily {{ settings.INSTITUTION_NAME|texescape }} students.
The content and difficulty of the subjects varies significantly, from non-academic to college-level.
Our program is not accredited to issue credit for any class, however, we leave it to school administrators to decide whether {{ settings.ORGANIZATION_SHORT_NAME|texescape }} courses can be counted as substitutes for school classes.
You may view the teachers' course descriptions on the attached pages.
If you would like to talk to an administrator or teacher about the content of a particular course, please email us at {\tt {{ settings.DEFAULT_EMAIL_ADDRESSES.default|texescape }} }. \\
