{{ prog.anchor.parent.name }} courses are taught by volunteers, primarily MIT students.  The content and difficulty of the subjects varies significantly, from non-academic to college-level.  We are not an accredited institution and cannot issue high-school or college credit for any class.  However, we leave it to school administrators to decide whether ESP courses can be counted as substitutes for high-school classes.  You may view the teachers' course descriptions on the attached pages.  If you would like to talk to an administrator or teacher about the content of a particular course, please e-mail us at {\tt esp@mit.edu} or call us at (617) 253-4882. \\
