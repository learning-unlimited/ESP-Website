    <h1>{{program.niceName}} Registration Type Management</h1>
    <br />
    <p>Select the types of registrations that should appear on the inline student schedule that appears at the bottom of the main studentreg page. Enrolled should always be selected. Additionally:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are running a normal student registration, that is probably all that you need to select.</li>
        <li>If you are using an application, you should make sure to select Applied. To avoid confusion, de-select this before allowing students to see what classes they got into.</li>
        <li>If you are running a single-preference lottery, you should select Priority/1 and Interested. To avoid confusion, de-select these before allowing students to see what classes they got into.</li>
        <li>If you are running a multi-preference lottery, you should select Priority/1, Priority/2, etc. To avoid confusion, de-select these before allowing students to see what classes they got into.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When in doubt, contact <a href="mailto:{{ support }}">{{ support }}</a> for assistance.</p>
    <p>You may also select All to have all registration types display (which was the original default behavior). Only select this if you are sure that you want students to be able to see everything (something which has caused confusion in the past).</p>
