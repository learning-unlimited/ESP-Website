<p><em>This is intended to be read by program directors, webmins, or whoever else is
setting up the scheduling assistant before scheduling.</em></p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>The Automatic Scheduling Assistant is configured with per-program
<strong>Tags</strong>. A Tag is program-wide or site-wide setting (in this
case, program-wide) for the ESP website, created on the admin panel. Existing
tags for this program can be viewed <a href="/admin/tagdict/tag/?content_type__model=program&object_id={{ program.id }}">
here</a>.</p>

<h3>Creating a Tag</h3>
<p>
Different components of the Scheduling Assistant are configured by separate
tags. To create a tag:</p>
<ol>

    <li>Check to make sure the Tag does not already exist for this program on
        the <a href="/admin/tagdict/tag/?content_type__model=program&object_id={{ program.id }}">
        admin panel</a>.</li>
    <li>Click the <a href="/admin/tagdict/tag/add/">Add Tag</a> button.</li>

    <li>The <em>Key</em> should be the name of the tag, such as 
        <code>autoscheduler_constraint_overrides</code> for Constraints.
        See the sections below for more details on what this should be.</li>
    <li>The <em>Value</em> should be a JSON dict. See the next section for what that
        means, and see the sections below for more concretely what to put in
        the dict. Each section comes with an example you can copy-paste into
        the admin panel and modify.</li>
    <li>The <em>Content type</em> should be "program".</li>
    <li>The <em>Object id</em> should be {{ program.id }}, the ID of this
        program.</li>
</ol>

<h3>JSON</h3>

<p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. If you're familiar with Python,
the syntax is very similar to that of a <code>dict</code> literal. There's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example">
Wikipedia page</a> describing the syntax.</p>

<p>Note that what this page calls a "JSON dict" other pages call "JSON objects";
the difference is because a JSON object translates to a Python dict. When I
say "mapping from x to y", I mean x should come before the colon and y should
come after.</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>To change the defaults on whether non-required constraints are on or off, use
the tag <code>autoscheduler_constraint_overrides</code>. The content of the
tag should be a JSON dict mapping from the name of the constraint to a boolean
(note that JSON booleans are "true" and "false", not "True" and "False"),
like:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "LunchConstraint": false
}
</code></pre>
<p>with different items separated by commas.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>To change the defaults on scorer weights, use the tag
<code>autoscheduler_scorer_weight_overrides</code>. The content of the tag is
once again a JSON dict, this time mapping from the name of the scorer to a
floating point number. For example:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "NumSectionsScorer": 200.0,
    "NumTeachersScorer": 80.0
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Resource Criteria</h2>

<h3>Specifications</h3>
<p>Resource Criteria are essentially search terms on the resources a class
requests, the resources a classroom has, or the name of a classroom, which the
Automatic Scheduling Assistant is either required to or encouraged to satisfy
when it is moving classes around. To add a Resource Criterion, you need to
write a <strong>specification</strong>.</p>

<p>The syntax is as follows, where <strong>all caps</strong> denotes a variable and
<strong>brackets</strong> denote an optional argument:</p>
<pre><code>if PREMISE then CONCLUSION</code></pre>

where PREMISE and CONCLUSION can be of the form
<pre><code>[not] section requests RESTYPE [with VALUE_REGEX]</code></pre>
or
<pre><code>[not] classroom has RESTYPE [with VALUE_REGEX]</code></pre>
or
<pre><code>[not] classroom matches NAME_REGEX</code></pre>
or
<pre><code>any section</code></pre>

<p>and where PREMISE and CONCLUSION must not both be section criteria or both
be classroom criteria. Regular expressions should follow Python's
<code>re</code> package syntax. (If you're not familiar with regular
expressions, find a friendly neighborhood CS major to help you.) See below for
examples. Please note that <strong>specifications, including resource types,
    are case sensitive and also don't tolerate extra whitespace</strong>.</p>

<h3>Specification Examples</h3>

<p>Suppose we think document cameras are really important, so any class which
requested a document camera can get one. Then we could write the following
specification:</p>
<pre><code>if section requests Document Camera then classroom has Document
    Camera</code></pre>

<p>Conversely, suppose we don't have many LCD projectors, so any class which
<em>doesn't</em> request a projector shouldn't get one. Then we could write
the following specification:</p>
<pre><code>if not section requests LCD Projector then not classroom has LCD
Projector</code></pre>

<p>Suppose you want classrooms which request Music Rooms to only be scheduled
in Music Rooms (and suppose that this is represented on the website by the
resource "Classroom space" with value "Music room with piano"). Then we could
write:</p>
<pre><code>if section requests Classroom space with .*Music room.* then
classroom has Classroom space with .*Music room.*</code></pre>

<p>Suppose you're like MIT and most of your regular classrooms
are numbered rooms, like "26-100", and your weird rooms are not, like
"McDermott Dot". Then we could write a specification which only allows classes
to be scheduled in numbered rooms, like:</p>
<pre><code>if any section then classroom matches ^\\d+-\\d+$</code></pre>
<p>Note that this restriction automatically also excludes specially labelled
rooms like "1-115 (computer cluster)", which may or may not be a good
thing.</p>

<h3>Tag Syntax</h3>
<p>There are ResourceCriteria Constraints, and ResourceCriteria Scorers. The
former imposes a hard restriction; the latter imposes a soft restriction.
These are controlled by separate Tags.</p>

<p>In general, the Resource Criteria tags map from the name of the Resource
Criterion (which can be whatever you want it to be) to the specification. You
can also turn off a Resource Criterion by setting the specification to "None"
(including quotes). Since regular expressions are confusing, you can
optionally include a comment in your tag. JSON doesn't support comments
natively, so to include a comment, create an entry with "_comment" in the
key, and set your comment as the value. If a Resource Criterion has a comment
with a matching name, the comment is used for the help text on this page
instead of the specification string.</p>

<p>You should not have duplicate Resource Criterion names, not even between
constraints and scorers. I'm not entirely sure what happens if you do.</p>

<h3>Resource Criteria Constraints</h3>
<p>A ResourceCriteria Constraint creates a condition that the automatic
scheduling assistant will not violate, for example if you want to force it to
only schedule classes in main-group classrooms, or if you don't want to
schedule non-computer classes into computer clusters (or if you want to
schedule computer classes only into computer clusters, but I recommend you do
those by hand anyway because of OS and software considerations.)</p>

<p>To add or remove ResourceCriteria constraints, use the tag
<code>autoscheduler_resource_constraint_overrides</code>. The format should be
a JSON dict mapping from the name of the criterion (which can be whatever you
want) to the specification string, or to "None" if you need to disable a default
constraint. Note that the scheduler will <em>not</em> break if you include a
Constraint that is violated by existing classes; the scheduler will simply not
introduce any new violations.</p>

<p>By default, the website comes with the "restrict_star_classrooms"
constraint, which means that no new classes will be scheduled in rooms marked
with a star in the name, e.g. *16-628.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "restrict_non_main":
        "if any section then classroom matches ^\\d+-\\d+$",
    "restrict_non_main_comment":
         "Only schedule into rooms with simple numeric names like 26-100"
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Resource Criteria Scorers</h3>

<p>A ResourceCriteria Scorer creates a condition that the assistant is
encouraged to satisfy. <strong>Note that the Automatic Scheduling Assistant
automatically comes with the ResourceMatchingScorer and
ResourceValueMatchingScorer</strong>, which are entirely separate, and
generically encourage the assistant to schedule classes into rooms which have
resources they want. You should use a ResourceCriteria Scorer if you
<em>particularly</em> want to weight one resource over the others (in which case you
can consider using a constraint instead) or there's a resource condition that
is more complex that aforementioned scorers don't understand.</p>

<p>To add or remove ResourceCriteria scorers, use the tag
<code>autoscheduler_resource_scoring_overrides</code>. The website comes with
no default ResourceCriteria Scorers. The format is a JSON dict mapping from
the name of the criterion to a pair containing the specification and a weight.
Note that Python's tuple syntax is <em>not</em> supported by JSON, so the pair
should be bracket-delimited, not parenthesis-delimited. Scorers are
re-weighted so that the highest-weight scorer has weight 1, which means that
(roughly speaking) adding more criteria shouldn't weaken existing ones. To
change the total weight of ResourceCriteria Scorers, modify the appropriate
weight in the Scoring section above.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "music_rooms":
        ["if section requests Classroom space with Music Room then classroom
matches .*(Music Room)", 1.0]
}
</code></pre>
