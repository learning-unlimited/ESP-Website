<h2>List of Classes</h2>

<br />

<p>Some notes:
<ol>
<li>The feasible times for a class depend heavily on the availability of the teachers.  You will not be able to schedule a class until all of its teachers are available in a timeblock that is at least the length of the class.  <a href="/manage/{{ prog.getUrlBase }}/force_availability">Click here</a> to fix teacher availability if some classes have no feasible times.
<li>There is a lot information contained within this table.  Hover your mouse over almost anything to find out more information about it.
<li>You may make multiple updates and click any 'Alter' button to apply all of them.  
<li>If you change the time of a class section that has already been assigned a room, the system may clear the room assignment if another section is in that room.  You cannot change both the time and room of a class in the same update; please see what rooms are available after changing the time.
<li>This page does not support assigning multiple rooms to a class, but you can do that using the "manage class" page (linked from the <a href="/manage/{{ prog.getUrlBase }}/dashboard">dashboard</a>).
</ol>
