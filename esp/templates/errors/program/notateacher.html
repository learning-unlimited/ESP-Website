<h1>Not a Teacher!</h1>

<p>
<strong>
Sorry, but according to our records, you did not register as a teacher.
</strong>
<br />
You can still participate in our programs, just not as a teacher. Please register for this and other programs when student registration appears!

<br />
Thank you for your understanding.
<br /><br />
<em>If you feel you are a valid teacher, and you still are getting this error message, please email us at <u>{{ DEFAULT_EMAIL_ADDRESSES.support }}</u></em>.
