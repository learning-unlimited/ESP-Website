<h2>Select a list of users</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Basic list</b>: A set of users that all have something in common.</li>
        <li><b>Combination list</b>: A Boolean combination of basic lists.</li>
        {% if include_prev_list %}
        <li><b>Previous e-mails</b>: Start from the settings that were used for a previous e-mail message.</li>
        {% endif %}
    </ul>
