<h1>Select Mailing List(s)</h1>
<br />

<p>Please select the mailing list or lists whose users you would like to e-mail.</p>

<p>Note that we're <b>not permitted to send advertisements</b> through this Web interface, because it doesn't provide Unsubscribe support properly like the regular mailing lists do.  These are also real mailing lists; just send mail to them instead.</p>

<p>If you need to e-mail a list of people that's not here, poke a Webmin!  They're really not that hard to make.</p>

<p>You can click <a href="{{request.path}}?advanced">here</a> to use the Advanced User-Search Panel to generate lists of users via database queries.  If you're sending e-mail, though, please don't use the Advanced version unless you really know what you're doing!</p>

<!-- Future Webmins, in case you're wondering why not to use the Advanced Comm Panel to send e-mail:  First, that whole codepath has lots of issues that can cause it to produce a slightly different set of users than you're expecting, particularly for more-complex combination queries.  It turns out that relational logic is complicated and subtle...  Second, there's not only no Unsubscribe mechanism for Advanced Comm Panel e-mails; there's no reasonable way of making one. -->


<form action="{{request.path}}" method="post" name="comm">

<p>Click on a list to select it.  Ctrl-click to select multiple lists; your e-mail will be sent once to each user whose e-mail address is on any of the lists.</p>

<select name="select_mailman" multiple size=10>
{% for lst in nonpublic_lists %}<option value="{{ lst }}">{{ lst }}@esp.mit.edu</option>
{% endfor %}{% for lst in public_lists %}<option value="{{ lst }}">{{ lst }}@esp.mit.edu</option>
{% endfor %}</select>
