# ESP Website
This repository contains a website to help manage the logistics of preparing for and running large, short-term educational programs. It is written and maintained by members and alums of the interscholastic Splash community and [Learning Unlimited](https://learningu.org). Documentation for [program administrators](/docs/admin) and [developers](/docs/dev) is in the [`docs`](/docs) directory, including [dev setup documentation](/docs/dev/vagrant.rst) and [instructions for contributors](/docs/dev/contributing.rst).  Additional documentation for chapters of Learning Unlimited is on the [LU Wiki](https://wiki.learningu.org).
