# ESP Website
A website to help manage the logistics of large short-term educational programs

This website was written by the [MIT Educational Studies Program](https://esp.mit.edu) to support [Splash](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash) and other educational programs.  It is now supported by [Learning Unlimited](https://learningu.org) with support from administrators of the MIT Educational Studies Program and other Splash programs across the country.

Documentation for [program administrators](/docs/admin) and [developers](/docs/dev) is in the [`docs`](/docs) directory, including [dev setup documentation](/docs/dev/vagrant.rst) and [instructions for contributors](/docs/dev/contributing.rst).  Additional documentation for chapters of Learning Unlimited is on the [LU Wiki](https://wiki.learningu.org).
